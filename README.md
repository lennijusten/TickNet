# TickNet
Deep learning for tick identification

Hello humans. This project contains the necessary codes for image-based tick classification with a trained neural network. The program uses an ONNX neural network model to classify to common midwest species: Ixodes scapularis and Dermacentor variabilis. 

The model was developed in matlab's deep learning tool box.
